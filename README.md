# Deep Learning on Processing

Back Propagation test on processing.

The test class includes visualization of an approximation of aribitrary f: R -> R function by using back propagation method. As a default, this system tries to approximate sinusoidal function.

There seems to be a limitation that sigmoid function that is used on neural network's feed forward system can approximate only either monotonic decreasing or increasing function. This limitation may be fixed by dividing the domain of function.
